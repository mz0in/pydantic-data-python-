# Solution for GitHub Actions Workflow Failure

## Introduction
The GitHub Actions workflow for the repository has been failing due to certain errors. This document provides a detailed solution to fix the issue and ensure the successful execution of the workflow.

## Error Analysis
Based on the error logs, the main cause of the failure seems to be related to the execution of the `pytest` command. The logs indicate that some tests are failing, leading to the overall failure of the workflow.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the test failures could be due to outdated dependencies or incorrect configuration in the `github_actions_workflow.yml` file.

## Solution Steps
To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Update Dependencies: Ensure that all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file are up to date. You can use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` to update the dependencies.

2. Modify `github_actions_workflow.yml`: Open the `github_actions_workflow.yml` file and make the following changes:

   - In the `Run tests` step, modify the `pytest` command to redirect the output to the `error_logs.txt` file. Replace the line `pytest` with `pytest > error_logs.txt`.

3. Commit and Push Changes: Commit the modified `github_actions_workflow.yml` file and push the changes to the repository.

## Testing
To test the solution, follow these steps:

1. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow by pushing a new commit to the repository.

2. Monitor the workflow execution and check the generated `error_logs.txt` file for any error messages.

3. If the workflow completes successfully and no errors are reported in the `error_logs.txt` file, the issue has been resolved.
